# Exploring Bias Mimicking as a Machine Learning Method for Mitigating Bias

This project is based off the bias mitigation method "Bias Mimicking"  proposed by researchers from Boston University and the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. I explore the method trough my own analysis and dig into ethical considerations. Bias in machine learning models poses a threat to people who are marginalized by the dataset. As machine learning models become more and more integral to our everyday lives, we must ensure they follow ethical frameworks.
